This repository contains a fully modeled, assembled, and rendered CAD representation of the Bombardier Global 8000 ultra-long-range business jet, created entirely in SolidWorks.
The project focuses on accurate geometry, subsystem modeling, clean assemblies, and high-quality visualization, culminating in motion studies of the jet engines and multiple rendered views of the aircraft.

This project was completed as a personal aerospace CAD project to strengthen skills in aircraft geometry, parametric modeling, assemblies, and visualization workflows.

Project Scope

The following major aircraft components and subsystems were modeled from scratch and assembled into a complete aircraft:

Major Aircraft Components

Fuselage

 -Smooth lofted body with realistic proportions

 -Cockpit windows and passenger windows

 -Door geometry and surface continuity

Wing

 -Custom wing geometry (non-standard airfoil profiles)

 -Wing-body integration

 -Clean fillets and transitions

Empennage (Tail)

 -Horizontal stabilizer

 -Vertical stabilizer

 -Tail-fuselage blending

Engines

 -GE Passport 20–inspired turbofan geometry

 -Nacelle, fan, and internal rotating components

 -Engine mounting and alignment
 

🔩 Subsystems & Assembly

Fully constrained top-level aircraft assembly

Proper mating and alignment of:

Wings

Engines

Tail surfaces

Fuselage
